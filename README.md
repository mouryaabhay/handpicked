## 🚀 About

When I first started in frontend development and web design, I found myself spending **more time searching for quality tools** and **resources** than actually improving my skills.

**Handpicked** was born from that frustration — a place where all the essentials are gathered, organized, and ready to use.
Now, it exists to help others who face the same struggles — with resources **curated by me and amazing contributors** from across the web.

Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, **Handpicked** aims to be your go-to starting point for modern web development.
